        <div class="panel">
        <p>The online graduate GIS Graduate Program at Fleming College is a full time course and the workload
            is quite intense. You need to dedicate a lot of time outside classes for assignments and studying to
            be able to make it through the course successfully.
        </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Is it possible to have a job whilst completing the GIS program?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>As the GIS program is full time and the workload is demanding outside of classes, students find it hard to 
            work a job alongside. Students who are not working, or are working very little hours find that they have more success 
            at completing the work and time management.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">How do online courses differ from in person classes?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>The online GIS Graduate program has been successfully running online for many years so it is well formatted for
            delivering content through an online structure. Classes are delivered from the teachers themselves and are designed
            to be interactive. There is some group work involved throughout the course which is a great chance to
            meet new people, even though you are not there in person.
        </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">What level of software knowledge is required?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p> You will need some degree of software knowledge and understanding. You will be using a lot of new
            software related to GIS which you are taught, however basic computer knowledge is required. 
            A lot of people who join this course from a variety of backgrounds, from Environmental to creative design,
            so you do not need a GIS background. There are of course some backgrounds that may tie in quite well with
            some of the contents of this course!
        </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">What is the difference between Applications and Cartographic specialist?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p> The applications specialist will dive deeper into data management. The cartographic specialist on the other hand, 
            will focus more on the visuals.
        </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">What will I be Learning?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p> You will be learning a whole host of skills that are commonly used in the GIS field. You will be covering
            areas suchs as Remote sensing, Problem Solving, Database Principles, Geovisualization, Spatial Analysis 
            and web design! The website you are looking at right now was made using the skills learn in the first term 
            of the program. How neat is that?
