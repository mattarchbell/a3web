            <h2>Tips On Staying Healthy</h2>
            <h5>1. Hydrate</h5>
            <img src="images/water.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Glass of Water">
            <p>Drinking water is one of the most basic necessities to survival, and no matter how busy things get, 
                it is important that we do not neglect our bodies. Staying hydrated will help keep your energy levels 
                throughout the day.</p>
            <h6>2. Eat right and snack</h6>
            <img src="images/food.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Food">
            <p>When learning solely online, it may be tempting to roll out of bed and go to class, however, the age old 
                "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day" saying does not end here. Don't skip meals, eat to replenish 
                your body and your brain.</p>
            <h6>3. Exercise</h6>
            <img src="images/walk.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Footstep">
            <p>We all know the health benefits of staying active. But here's a friendly reminder that there is time for work 
                and play. Finding time to exercise will give your brain a much needed break. 
                Some options for staying active during quarantine include: working out before class, after class or when your 
                brain needs a break.</p>
            <h6>4. Prioritize rest: stick to a schedule</h6>
            <img src="images/workout.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Dumbbell">
            <p>Overworking may seem inevitable especially with 7 courses per semester, but try your best to improve your time 
                management skills and stick to a realistic schedule that you set for yourself.</p>
            <h6>5. Become a pro napper</h6>
            <img src="images/sleep.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Bed">
            <p>Naps may be your best friend in this intensive online program: 20 minutes during the day can go a long way 
                especially if you had a late night.</p>
            <h6>6. Get fresh air</h6>
            <img src="images/outside.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Outside">
            <p>Go for a bike ride, a hike, a stroll around your neighbourhood, walk your dog, build a snowman... 
                Find excuses and/or reasons for you to get yourself outside! Removing yourself from your desk can help you 
                clear your mind and change your perspective on a problem you may find yourself stuck on.</p>
            <h6>7. Listen to your body</h6>
            <img src="images/health.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Stethoscope">
            <p>Take a sick day if you need it. If you're feeling ill physically or mentally, it is better to take a day 
                and recuperate than to push yourself further into an unwell state.</p>
            <h6>8. Find positive classmates to work collaborate with</h6>
            <img src="images/stayPositive.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Hand Holding Heart">
            <p>Although you're taking this program online, and you may feel as though you're alone, you are far from it!
                Communicating with peers and working through problems together will help you realize that you have peers
                that are in the same boat!</p>
            <h6>9. Ask for help</h6>
            <img src="images/Chair.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Chair">
            <p>Don't hesitate to ask for help. Through this program, you will learn a great deal on the importance of teamwork.
                If you're struggling, remember that there are tutors, classmates and your instructors that you can reach out to for help.</p>
            <h6>10. Set goals for yourself</h6>
            <img src="images/goals.png" width="100" height="100" alt="To-Do List">
            <p>The heavy course load in this assignments call for good planning. Make realistic goals for yourself so that you don't fall behind.</p>
            <h6>11. Make friends</h6>
            <img src="images/friends.png" width="100" height="100" alt="Handshake">
            <p>Finally, don't forget the social aspect of learning! Don't miss out on this opportunity to meet those that have 
                the same interest as you do in GIS.</p></div>
